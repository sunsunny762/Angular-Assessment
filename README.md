## `I have Implement infinite scroll of author list Using Intersection Observer API:-`

For this method I have create directive

This is a custom method that sets up the IntersectionObserver. It creates an observer with specified options, including the root element, root margin, and threshold. The observer listens for changes in intersection and triggers a callback function when an intersection occurs. If the observed element is intersecting with its parent container, it logs a message to the console and emits true through the appIntersectionListener event emitter.
